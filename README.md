# Price prediction problem using neural networks.

The aim is to predict the price of AirBnb rooms using all the features available in the dataset. This leads to a problem with two inputs data (numeric and image) that we are going to try to solve using Deep Learning techniques.
The following image summarizes the architecture to be developed.
